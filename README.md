Jupyter notebook containing the code for demonstrating the hyper parameter tuning. We have built a cardiac disease prediction model using decision tree classifier trained on the Cleveland heart disease dataset. The improvement in the classification performance after the process of hyper parameter tuning is demonstrated .
